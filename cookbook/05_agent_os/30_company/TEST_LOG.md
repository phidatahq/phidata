# Test Log: Company Products

### 01_manage_products.py

**Status:** PASS

**Description:** Ran `cookbook/05_agent_os/30_company/01_manage_products.py`
with the development environment on October 15, 2026, after simplifying the
internal scope-map handoff (SQLAlchemy 2.0.54). SQLite persistence,
two users, unscoped and owner-filtered listings, soft delete, include_deleted,
and restore were exercised.

**Result:** All assertions passed. Output:

```text
Isolation off: 2 Products
Isolation on for alice: 1 Product
Soft delete, include_deleted and restore passed
```

### 02_manage_projects.py

**Status:** PASS

**Description:** Ran `cookbook/05_agent_os/30_company/02_manage_projects.py`
on October 15, 2026 using SQLite and the development environment. Tested two
owners, unscoped and scoped listing, reasoned Project transitions, status
filtering, soft delete and restore without a model.

**Result:** All assertions passed; output: `Company projects lifecycle passed`.

### 03_manage_tasks.py

**Status:** PASS

**Description:** Ran `cookbook/05_agent_os/30_company/03_manage_tasks.py`
on October 15, 2026 using SQLite and the development environment. Tested
Backlog creation, executor and acceptor recording, frozen scope, returning to
Backlog and clearing acceptance, review/completion, filtering, delete and
restore. This example manages records without executing a model.

**Result:** All assertions passed. Output:

```text
Accepted scope is protected
Company tasks lifecycle passed
```

The existing `01_manage_products.py` was also rerun successfully with its
original output and assertions unchanged.


### Rebase verification: all Company examples

**Status:** PASS

**Description:** Reran `01_manage_products.py`, `02_manage_projects.py`, and
`03_manage_tasks.py` on October 15, 2026 after rebasing onto Products commit
`850ebb87a6a78c73392fd3c0a998ce9c18f8a823`, including its database shutdown
and async configuration reconstruction fixes. The new Project/Task inserts
also use the same required-row return convention as Products.

**Result:** All assertions passed. Products reported two unscoped records,
one Alice-owned record, and successful archive/restore checks. Projects
reported lifecycle success. Tasks reported protected accepted scope and
lifecycle success.
