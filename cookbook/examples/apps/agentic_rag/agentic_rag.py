"""🤖 Agentic RAG Agent - Your AI Knowledge Assistant!

This advanced example shows how to build a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that
leverages vector search and LLMs to provide deep insights from any knowledge base.

The agent can:
- Process and understand documents from multiple sources (PDFs, websites, text files)
- Build a searchable knowledge base using vector embeddings
- Maintain conversation context and memory across sessions
- Provide relevant citations and sources for its responses
- Generate summaries and extract key insights
- Answer follow-up questions and clarifications

Example queries to try:
- "What are the key points from this document?"
- "Can you summarize the main arguments and supporting evidence?"
- "What are the important statistics and findings?"
- "How does this relate to [topic X]?"
- "What are the limitations or gaps in this analysis?"
- "Can you explain [concept X] in more detail?"
- "What other sources support or contradict these claims?"

The agent uses:
- Vector similarity search for relevant document retrieval
- Conversation memory for contextual responses
- Citation tracking for source attribution
- Dynamic knowledge base updates

View the README for instructions on how to run the application.
