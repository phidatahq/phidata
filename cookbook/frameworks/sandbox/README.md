# Sandbox execution primitives

Run commands in a customer-operated Docker environment for trusted teams. This is the compute foundation for session sandboxes. It does not yet connect Claude/Codex agents to AgentOS or provide durable session recovery.

This is different from `DockerTools`, which gives an agent tools to manage containers on the host. `DockerSandbox` gives each session its own isolated container that the agent works inside.

Install the repository development environment and Docker, then run:

```bash
docker pull python:3.12-slim
.venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/docker_execution.py
```

The example creates a sandbox container, writes and reads a file, reuses that container and deletes it. No model credentials are needed. Set `AGNO_SANDBOX_IMAGE` to a trusted Linux image containing `python`; pin its digest for repeatable deployments. The Docker context on the service host selects the trusted daemon and its authentication configuration.

`DockerSandbox(image=..., memory_mb=...)` holds settings shared by every session of an agent. `create(session_id, agent_id=None, generation=1, env=None)` identifies one session and returns a `SandboxHandle`; pass that handle to `exec`, `stop` and `destroy` so a stale caller can never act on a newer container that reuses the name. `namespace` (default `"default"`) separates deployments sharing a daemon. Repeating `create` with the same identity and configuration returns a handle to the same running container, including after an uncertain creation response. A stopped generation cannot be restarted through `create`: recovery must call `create` with a new `generation`. This prevents accidentally treating lost tmpfs files as retained session state.

`DockerSandbox` offers `create/get/exec/stop/destroy` and their asynchronous `acreate/aget/aexec/astop/adestroy` counterparts. Command arguments are passed as a sequence; explicitly use `sh -c` when shell syntax is intended. Nonzero command exits are returned as `ExecResult`; infrastructure failures raise `SandboxError`. Uncertain commands are never retried automatically.

## Warm reuse between turns

```bash
.venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/warm_reuse.py
```

The example does a turn's worth of work, writing a file and leaving a background process running, then pauses the container. Pausing uses the kernel freezer: files, memory and processes stay exactly as they are, no bytes are copied anywhere, and commands are refused until the container resumes. The next turn calls `resume` and gets the same container back running, with the file present and the background process continuing from where it froze; `create` on the paused generation is refused. The example then stops the container to show the cold path: the tmpfs files are gone, the generation cannot restart, and the next turn needs generation 2 restored from a checkpoint.

`pause`, `resume` and their async counterparts are part of the `Sandbox` contract. A provider without a native pause raises `NotImplementedError`, so a caller can fall back to keeping the container running or to the cold path. A paused container is still tied to one host and still counts against its memory, so pausing complements checkpoints rather than replacing them: checkpoints remain the recovery path when the host or the container is gone.

## A live Claude session in a sandbox

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
.venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/claude_runtime.py
```

The example runs two Claude turns on one session inside a container built from the runtime image, with a pause between them. Turn 1 asks Claude to write and run a program; its tool calls and content stream back through the runtime journal, the file lands in `/workspace`, and Claude Code's own session is kept under `/runtime/native` next to the local history database. The container is then paused and resumed. Turn 2 asks, without tools, what the previous turn did. Claude answers from its native session, and the example asserts the Claude session id recorded on the local session row is the same for both turns.

Only the selected model credential is forwarded into the container environment. `runtime_config` holds the `ClaudeAgent` settings (model, permission mode, allowed tools, turn limit); the runtime adds the workspace, the local database and the strict settings itself. The execution result is output, not a completed run: the coordinator layer that checkpoints and commits it to the service database is a later PR, so this example writes nothing outside the container.

## Boundaries

- The image, Docker daemon and its administrator are trusted. This is not a hostile multitenant isolation service.
- UID/GID 1000, read-only image filesystem, dropped capabilities, no privilege escalation, explicit CPU/memory/process limits, no host bind mounts or Docker socket mounts.
- Networking defaults to `none`. Set an operator-managed network or `bridge` explicitly when required. Host and other-container network sharing are rejected. Egress policy and DNS filtering belong to deployment infrastructure.
- Only explicitly configured environment values are added to the image environment. Do not put AgentOS database/Redis credentials in the image or sandbox environment. Image-baked credentials are also visible to repository code.
- `/workspace` and `/runtime` (`HOME`) use Docker-managed bounded tmpfs volumes, allowing daemon checkpoint transfer while the container is paused. `/tmp` is a container tmpfs. Stopping or removing compute loses these files. A later checkpoint layer must establish durability before completed-turn recovery can be promised.
- Command output is bounded by raw bytes, then decoded with UTF-8 replacement. Timeouts, excessive output, cancellation and uncertain command transport stop the whole container to terminate remote child processes. A stop failure is an infrastructure error requiring reconciliation; do not start a replacement writer until shutdown is confirmed. Completed commands can intentionally leave background applications running.
- Caller cancellation during creation may leave an allocated container. Reconcile by calling `create` again with the same identity/configuration; do not invent another generation until the previous allocation is accounted for.
- `pause` and `resume` are the warm path between turns. A paused container keeps its files, memory and processes under the kernel freezer; `resume` brings the same generation back running with nothing to restore. `create` refuses a paused generation, because only the caller that paused it knows its files are whole; anyone else destroys it and recovers a new generation from the checkpoint. Commands are refused while paused. `stop` and `destroy` remain the cold path and lose the tmpfs files, so a later turn needs a new generation restored from a checkpoint. Pausing does not replace checkpoints: a paused container is still tied to one host.
- No preview, nested Docker, artifact API, shared admission, checkpoint or terminal-success semantics are implied by this sandbox.

## Validation

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest libs/agno/tests/unit/sandbox -q
AGNO_TEST_DOCKER_IMAGE=python:3.12-slim .venv/bin/python -m pytest libs/agno/tests/integration/sandbox -q
```

Integration tests use unique namespaces and remove only their own containers. See [TEST_LOG.md](TEST_LOG.md) for the tested environment and limits.

## Checkpoint archive and storage

```bash
.venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/checkpoint_files.py
```

This credential-free example captures real filesystem roots, uploads an immutable object, deletes the original files, and restores them through another store instance. `CheckpointArchive` requires `workspace` and `native` roots and a JSON state manifest. `FileCheckpointStore` stores immutable SHA-256-addressed bytes with size/checksum verification and atomic publication. Both classes provide sync and async operations.

Drain native SDK writes and quiesce all applications before capture. The native root must contain only restorable state; keep credentials outside it or explicitly exclude credential paths. Exclusions are exact relative paths (and their descendants), not glob expressions. Ignored and untracked workspace files are included. Safe relative symlinks and file permissions survive; hardlinked source files become separate files. Special files, escaping/cyclic links and malicious archives are rejected. Archive limits bound bytes, entry counts and metadata. Uncompressed tar avoids decompression bombs; restore validates all paths before materializing into a new directory. Restore never updates a running workspace in place.

The object directory and restore parent must be trusted coordinator-owned paths, never mounted into sandbox compute or exposed to agent tools. Production storage must survive the intended failure domain, for example a suitably configured shared filesystem; a service-local directory does not provide host-loss recovery. The demo uses temporary local disk and proves filesystem semantics only. Objects are not deleted when compute is destroyed; retention needs a separate reconciler.

An upload is not a completed run. A following coordinator transaction must publish the checkpoint reference together with authoritative conversation/native metadata and terminal run state, fenced against the current session generation. These archive/store primitives do not implement that transaction, SDK capture, Docker transport or automatic session recovery. Async cancellation waits for in-progress filesystem work to finish, so cleanup does not race a background writer; callers must reconcile whether that operation completed.

## Reconnectable runtime journal

Build the runtime from public package sources only, then run a deterministic fixture:

```bash
.venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/build_image.py --tag agno-sandbox:local
.venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/runtime_journal.py
AGNO_TEST_RUNTIME_IMAGE=agno-sandbox:local .venv/bin/python -m pytest libs/agno/tests/integration/sandbox/test_runtime.py -q
```

The build sends a temporary context containing package sources and public packaging files, excluding local environments, credentials and unrelated working-tree files. It pins the Python base digest, Claude SDK, Codex SDK and SQLAlchemy; transitive packages and Debian packages are resolved at build time. Record the resulting image digest and dependency list for deployments. Docker's init process reaps detached runtime children.

`SandboxRuntimeClient` has sync/async start, poll, page iteration, wait and cancel operations. Start identity is `execution_id`, scoped to the session computer; retries with identical configuration/input attach to the existing execution. Different input under the same identity is rejected. The runtime also binds itself to one agent/session and permits one active writer. Its lock is a defensive local check, not a replacement for durable queue admission.

Polling uses byte cursors into the bounded event journal. Reconnecting or replaying does not invoke the SDK again. A completion/poll race cannot hide final events. A dead worker returns `execution_unknown`; callers must reconcile effects before choosing a new execution identity. Poll timeout/cancellation detaches the caller, while explicit runtime cancellation stops the whole computer and loses ephemeral files. Infrastructure transport failure still follows the provider's stop/reconciliation contract.

The deterministic `fixture` SDK requires the explicit test-only environment flag used in the example. It does not call a model. Production runtime requests accept `claude` or `codex` and JSON-compatible adapter configuration. Model/MCP credentials must be explicitly provisioned through the compute environment; broad service credentials must stay outside. SDK retries are disabled here so the coordinator owns retry decisions. Local SQLite is a native-state cache inside the computer; it is not the authoritative AgentOS database. `/runtime/native` contains the local session cache and SDK home directories. Quiesce it before capture, and exclude or separately provision SDK credential files.

Runtime frames deliberately suppress service terminal events. `execution_finished` includes the SDK run and local session metadata; its run may have succeeded, failed or been cancelled. AgentOS must validate the result, capture native/workspace state, fence ownership and atomically commit recovery metadata before publishing a successful terminal event. This PR does not yet register a sandbox agent in AgentOS, import existing Phase 1 sessions, stage remote media, provide historical workspace replay, or implement that durable completion transaction. Live Claude/Codex authentication and native recovery remain separate acceptance work. Do not interpret fixture acceptance as live SDK certification.


## Destroy and replace a session computer

```bash
AGNO_SANDBOX_IMAGE=agno-sandbox:local .venv/bin/python cookbook/frameworks/sandbox/replace_computer.py
```

The example clones a deterministic local Git fixture, edits tracked code, runs its tests, and creates ignored/untracked files and a native-state fixture. It captures one immutable checkpoint, destroys compute and its volumes, restores into generation 2, reruns the application tests, then retrieves an artifact after all compute is gone. No network or model credentials are required.

`DockerCheckpointTransfer` provides sync/async capture and restore. Capture pauses compute for two bounded raw archive exports, resumes it, then validates and uploads the combined archive. Docker never extracts an untrusted archive on the service host. Restore verifies the immutable checkpoint, requires an empty computer, and writes directly into the writable managed volumes while preserving UID 1000 access. Failure after partial restoration stops that generation. The managed roots retain their configured ownership/permissions; permissions beneath the roots are restored.

Plain container tmpfs is rejected by the transport: Docker can return a successful but empty copy for it. The provider now creates labeled, bounded, daemon-visible tmpfs volumes and verifies their configuration on reuse. Destruction removes only matching owned volumes, including recovery after a lost container-removal response. A failed create before a container exists removes its unmounted volumes, so a corrected configuration can retry the same generation; a coordinator crash in that window can still leave labeled empty volumes for reconciliation. A paused generation is never resumed implicitly: `create` and `exec` reject it, because a warm pause looks the same as an interrupted capture or a partial restore. Only the caller that paused it calls `resume`; anyone else uses `stop` or `destroy`, then a new generation. These volumes still provide no host-loss durability; the external checkpoint store does.

The caller must hold exclusive generation ownership and finish/drain the SDK before capture. Applications requiring logical database backups need an explicit quiesce/backup procedure; pausing processes only establishes a filesystem capture boundary. No nested-container or anonymous-volume data is included. Current capture uses local staging space for raw and combined archives in the coordinator's object directory; provision several times the checkpoint byte limit per concurrent capture. A transfer is bounded to 120 seconds per root. These limits intentionally fail finalization rather than publish an incomplete recovery point.

The known Codex `auth.json` and Claude `.credentials.json` paths are excluded by default. These defaults are not a secret scanner: use explicit exclusions or keep other credentials outside durable roots. Passing `exclude` replaces the default list. Keep native credentials provisioned separately for restored compute. Atomic run/conversation/checkpoint publication still belongs to the following AgentOS coordinator layer.

Archive validation stays strict: absolute or root-escaping symlinks and special files such as FIFOs fail capture, and the error names the offending path. Virtual environments usually link `bin/python` to the image interpreter by absolute path, so exclude them and recreate them after restore from the project's lock file:

```python
ref = transfer.capture(handle, state=state, exclude=(*DEFAULT_NATIVE_EXCLUSIONS, "workspace/.venv"))
...
transfer.restore(new_handle, ref)
sandbox.exec(new_handle, ["sh", "-c", "cd /workspace && python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt"])
```

Reinstalling needs network access or a local package source, since sandbox networking defaults to `none`. Exclusions are never inferred, so dependencies are not dropped silently.
