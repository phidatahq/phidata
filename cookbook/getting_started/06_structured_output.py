well-formatted movie script concepts. It shows two approaches:
1. JSON Mode: Traditional JSON response parsing
2. Structured Output: Enhanced structured data handling

Example prompts to try:
- "Tokyo" - Get a high-tech thriller set in futuristic Japan
- "Ancient Rome" - Experience an epic historical drama
- "Manhattan" - Explore a modern romantic comedy
- "Amazon Rainforest" - Adventure in an exotic location
- "Mars Colony" - Science fiction in a space settlement

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.
