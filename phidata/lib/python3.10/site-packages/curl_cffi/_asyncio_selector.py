"""Ensure asyncio selector methods (add_reader, etc.) are available
tornado 6.1 adds AddThreadSelectorEventLoop event loop,
running select in a thread and defining these methods on the running event loop.
This factors out the functionality of AddThreadSelectorEventLoop
into a standalone SelectorThread object which can be attached to any running event loop.
