        Algorithm 3.2a Computing an encryption key.

        To understand the algorithm below, it is necessary to treat the O and U
        strings in the Encrypt dictionary as made up of three sections.
        The first 32 bytes are a hash value (explained below). The next 8 bytes
        are called the Validation Salt. The final 8 bytes are called the Key Salt.

        1. The password string is generated from Unicode input by processing the
           input string with the SASLprep (IETF RFC 4013) profile of
           stringprep (IETF RFC 3454), and then converting to a UTF-8
           representation.
        2. Truncate the UTF-8 representation to 127 bytes if it is longer than
           127 bytes.
        3. Test the password against the owner key by computing the SHA-256 hash
           of the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of owner
           Validation Salt, concatenated with the 48-byte U string. If the
           32-byte result matches the first 32 bytes of the O string, this is
           the owner password.
           Compute an intermediate owner key by computing the SHA-256 hash of
           the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of owner Key Salt,
           concatenated with the 48-byte U string. The 32-byte result is the
           key used to decrypt the 32-byte OE string using AES-256 in CBC mode
           with no padding and an initialization vector of zero.
           The 32-byte result is the file encryption key.
        4. Test the password against the user key by computing the SHA-256 hash
           of the UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of user
           Validation Salt. If the 32 byte result matches the first 32 bytes of
           the U string, this is the user password.
           Compute an intermediate user key by computing the SHA-256 hash of the
           UTF-8 password concatenated with the 8 bytes of user Key Salt.
           The 32-byte result is the key used to decrypt the 32-byte
           UE string using AES-256 in CBC mode with no padding and an
           initialization vector of zero. The 32-byte result is the file
           encryption key.
        5. Decrypt the 16-byte Perms string using AES-256 in ECB mode with an
           initialization vector of zero and the file encryption key as the key.
           Verify that bytes 9-11 of the result are the characters ‘a’, ‘d’, ‘b’.
           Bytes 0-3 of the decrypted Perms entry, treated as a little-endian
           integer, are the user permissions.
           They should match the value in the P key.

           (see 7.3.10, "Indirect Objects"). If the string is a direct object,

           the original n-byte encryption key to n + 5 bytes by appending the

        c) Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (b) as
           input to this function.
        d) Use the first (n + 5) bytes, up to a maximum of 16, of the output
           from the MD5 hash as the key for the RC4 or AES symmetric key
           algorithms, along with the string or stream data to be encrypted.
           If using the AES algorithm, the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode,
           which requires an initialization vector, is used. The block size
           parameter is set to 16 bytes, and the initialization vector is a
           16-byte random number that is stored as the first 16 bytes of the
           encrypted stream or string.

        Algorithm 3.1a Encryption of data using the AES algorithm
        1. Use the 32-byte file encryption key for the AES-256 symmetric key
           algorithm, along with the string or stream data to be encrypted.
           Use the AES algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, which
           requires an initialization vector. The block size parameter is set to
           16 bytes, and the initialization vector is a 16-byte random number
           that is stored as the first 16 bytes of the encrypted stream or string.
           The output is the encrypted data to be stored in the PDF file.
